# Squad-Defense
A mode I created some time ago while testing out ideas. In itself it doesn't create a complete mode.
It is a basic template for an idea that would work through a wave style mode but allowing more customisation that the other wave mode I created and would possibly make for the basis of more variation in enemies as well as a basic storyline.
I never did anything with it in the end but hold it here in case soemone might want it.
